Here I will be putting down my thoughts and actions concerning traning

After manual evaluation of 20180504's results it appears we are overtraining
past 20K steps. This can be seen in the detection of large knots especially.
It appears that 20000_20180504 is the best so far, even at detecting large
knots so I will replace the current model of 80000_20180503.
